## Project Plan
### What will we implement?
Our project will be about building a web application that will help individuals and groups manage their tasks efficiently. Users can create, assign, take notes and track tasks within projects or workplaces. The system also supports a timer for focus and productivity and some sort of documentation, collaboration through shared comments and files. We will also make it possible to create study groups.

Preliminary List of Features;

**Registration and Authentication** <br/>
  
**Task Management:**<br/> 
&nbsp; Create, edit, delete tasks.<br/>
&nbsp; Split tasks into subtasks.<br/>
&nbsp; Assign tasks to users or specific days. <br/>
&nbsp; Track task status (to do, in progress, done)<br/>  

**Documentation:**<br/>
&nbsp; Create, edit, and remove documentation pages<br/>
&nbsp; Being able to attach and manage files within documentation. <br/>

Collaboration:<br/>
&nbsp;being able to comment on tasks and documentation<br/>
&nbsp;Assign tasks to different members.<br/>

**Productivity:**<br/>
&nbsp;Built in focus timer (custamable)<br/>
&nbsp;Notifications/reminders for deadlines<br/>

**Workplace/project management:**<br/>
&nbsp;Create and manage multiple projects / workplaces<br/>
&nbsp;Invite or add users to projects<br/>


### Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Typescript, Javascript, html
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** [Node, React, Nextjs, Tailwindcss]

### Build System
We will use **npm** for managing dependencies and building the project. 

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Zwee42/TMUK14Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd TMUK14Project/hellosociallife
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Running the project as

    4.1 Development:
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
   
    4.2 Production:     
    ```sh
    npm run build
    npm run start
    ```
5. Automated Tests


   5.1   To run the test suite, use the following command
    ```sh
   npm run test
   ```
    - This will execute all defined unit tests and display the results in the terminal.


   5.2 To run tests with coverage reporting enabled, use:
     ```sh
   npm run test:coverage
   ```
     - This generates a coverage report, indicating how much of your codebase is covered by tests. The report includes details on statements, branches, functions, and lines tested.


   5.3 To check your code for linting errors, use:
    ```sh
   npm run lint

   ```  
   - This will highlight any syntax or style issues in your codebase.
